* I worked on an e-Commerce website base which manage vendors and customers like
eBay or Amazon.
* In this one I developed an import/export plugin to automate catalogue's
furnishing. Like this, vendors would be able to push their catalogue from their
own website automatically.
* I developed a second plugin to tax vendors. Because to working, this platform
needs money, that's why it takes some taxes on selling.
